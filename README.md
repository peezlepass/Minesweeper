# Welcome to a simple Minesweeper game!

## Installation

You can install it by doing all the work with cloning the repository to your local machine => npm install and then =>  npm start, but who am I kidding, you probably won't go through all that trouble, so here is a <a href="https://peezlepass.com/minesweeper">deployed version for you </a>.

This repository is frontend only, without the database, score table, or authentication. I actually have a more complex repo that includes all these features, which you can find <a href="https://github.com/bad-black-neko/final-project">here</a>. However, I understand that users can be hesitant to register, and without registering, there's no way to display the score table. So, to simplify things, this version only includes the game itself. Just you and the game. Win or lose. It's that simple.

## How to Play

<li>If the tile is not a bomb, it will display a number indicating how many bombs are adjacent to it.</li>
<li>Use this information to deduce the location of bombs and mark them with a flag by right-clicking on the tile.</li>
